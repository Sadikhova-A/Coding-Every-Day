- Day 2/Nov 10: Today I was learning how to use GitHub, continuing from yesterday. learning how to add a remote repo to GitHub. I made an SSH key and added it to GitHub but, my machine could not use it for some reason "git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey)." I'll be making repos in GitHub first then cloning them onto my machine as a work around
